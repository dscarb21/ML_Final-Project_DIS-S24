- **Group Members:** Pedro Cruz, Sydney Eriksson, David Scarborough
- **Professor:** Lucy McCarren
- **Class:** Machine Learning B - DIS Spring 2024

## Project Overview
The task of predicting similarity among TV shows holds significant importance as it can enhance the performance of algorithms in delivering personalized media to users. Our project aims to predict the similarity between Netflix shows based on their plots, contributing to the advancement of machine learning in media recommendation systems.

### Project Goal
Can we find similar Netflix shows by analyzing similarity of show descriptions? 
### Solution Idea
Fit different Netflix shows in a number of different clusters based on the most important words of their plot descriptions.

## Dataset

> [!NOTE]
> This dataset is from 2021. Using a more up-to-date dataset would be ideal for a more powerful model.

# What is Natural Language Processing?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses natural language as its primary input data type. Thus, we need to use Natural Language Processing techniques to handle data in this project.

Natural language processing, or NLP, combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical and machine learning models to enable computers and digital devices to recognize, understand and generate text and speech (IBM).
Several NLP tasks break down human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make sense of what it's ingesting. Some of these tasks include speech recognition, part of speech tagging, word sense disambiguation, translation, etc.
